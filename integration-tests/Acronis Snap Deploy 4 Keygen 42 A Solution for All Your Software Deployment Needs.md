# How to Use Acronis Snap Deploy 4 Keygen 42
 
Acronis Snap Deploy 4 is a software that allows you to deploy and provision multiple servers and workstations at once, using a disk image of a standard configuration[^2^]. It can save you time and resources by simplifying the deployment process. However, to use this software, you need a valid license key that you can purchase from the official website of Acronis[^1^].
 
If you don't have a license key, you might be tempted to use a keygen, which is a tool that generates random keys for software activation[^3^]. However, this is not a legal or safe way to use Acronis Snap Deploy 4. Keygens are often infected with malware or viruses that can harm your computer or compromise your data. Moreover, using a keygen is a form of software piracy, which is illegal and unethical. You could face legal consequences or penalties if you are caught using a keygen.
